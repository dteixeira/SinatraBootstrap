# This is a gemset definition for RVM. If you don't want to use this specific
# gemset just delete the line. If RVM is not installed this line can be left,
# but will do nothing.
#ruby-gemset=sinatra_bootstrap

# Pry is a Ruby shell, much more powerful than the standard shell (irb). It's
# not essencial to the project and you can opt no to install it, but it will
# make your life much easier. As this gem is not application breaking, no
# version is enforced.

# Shotgun is a reloading gem for Sinatra apps. It's easy to use, and might
# come in handy for small applications. It realoads the entire app not only
# on source modifications but also after every request, so it's completely
# overkill for large projects. Use at your own risk (and mental sanity).
# Internally, shotgun uses unix' fork, so it won't work on Windows. By default
# this bootstrap will use Sinatra Contrib's reloader.
# gem "shotgun", "~> 0.9"

# Thin is a ruby web server alternative to WebBrick. Contrary to WebBrick, Thin
# is solid and fast enough to be used in production, being tipically faster
# than Mongrel. To use Thin as the server just call "thin start -R config.ru".
gem "thin", "~> 1.6.1"

# TheRubyRacer is an embeds the V8 engine in Ruby. It's used to speed up

# member only knows one of the technologies, avoid using it.
gem "therubyracer", "~> 0.12.0"

# Slim is a very simple identation based template language, used to embed Ruby
# code in HTML. Slim files should have the ".slim" extension.

# It is fully compatible with CSS3, allowing mixing of both styles.
